# Prerequisites for Data Cleaning and Transformation

  Step 1:
  Import .csv file into Excel

  Step 2:
  Inspect and Clean the Data
  Remove Duplicates
  Fix Special Characters
    -> Replace `â‚¹` with an empty string.
  Convert to Proper Data Types
    -> Price Columns (discounted_price, actual_price) set to 2 decimal places.
    -> Rating column Set to 1 decimal place.
    -> Rating Count Set to 0 decimal places.
  Handle Special and Unauthorized Characters
    -> Replace any special unwanted characters (`ã€`) with an empty string.
    -> Check for unauthorized symbols in the 'rating' column and replace them with '0'.
  Fill or Remove Missing Data
    -> Inspect each column for missing values.
    -> Fill missing critical data appropriately or remove rows with missing essential data.

  Step 3: 
  Handle Multi-valued Cells
    -> For columns containing multiple values separated by commas (e.g., 'user_id', 'user_name', 'review_id'):
   Replace Commas with Semicolons
    -> replace all commas ',' with semicolons ';'.

  Step 4:
  Save the Cleaned Data
    -> Save the cleaned data back to a .csv file.
    -> Ensure the file is ready for import into PostgreSQL for further analysis.

  Step 5:
  Load Data into PostgreSQL
    -> Open PostgreSQL and use your preferred method (e.g., pgAdmin) to import the cleaned .csv file.
